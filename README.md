# Wind Turbine Power Prediction Project

This project is submitted as part of the **Edunet Foundation Internship**. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict the power output of a wind turbine based on real-world sensor data.

## üöÄ Project Goal

The main objective is to create a regression model that accurately predicts the **Actual Power (`actual_power_kw`)** generated by a turbine, using **Wind Speed (`wind_speed_ms`)** as the primary input.

This model will learn the non-linear "power curve" of the turbine directly from the data.

## üìä Data

### Data Source
* **Dataset:** Wind Turbine SCADA Dataset
* **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset)
* **File Used:** `T1.csv`

### Data Cleaning (Week 1)
The initial raw data (`T1.csv`) was loaded, analyzed, and cleaned. The following steps were performed:

1.  **Loaded Data:** The raw `T1.csv` file was loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Renamed Columns:** Columns were renamed for clarity (e.g., `LV ActivePower (kW)` to `actual_power_kw`).
3.  **Fixed Data Types:** The `Date/Time` column was converted to the proper `datetime` format.
4.  **Handled Outliers/Errors:** The primary cleaning step involved filtering out "nonsense" data. The main filter removed all rows where `actual_power_kw` was zero or negative, as these points represent times the turbine was off for maintenance or in a fault state, not generating power.
5.  **Saved Clean Data:** The resulting clean data was saved to `data/T1_cleaned.csv` and is used for all modeling.
